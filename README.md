# Data_Generators

# About the project

Aim of this project is to create tabular generators for categorical and for numerical data. This is also practical part to my bachelor thesis.

# Generators

Currently there are inluded 2 modifications of generative models -- Generative Adversal Networks (Goodfellow et al., 2014) and Variational Autoencoder (Kingma et al., 2014)
